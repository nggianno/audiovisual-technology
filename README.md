**"Music genre classification using Machine Learning algorithms"**

In this repo, implementations are based on 2 popular open-source music datasets [FMA](https://github.com/mdeff/fma) & [GTZAN](http://marsyas.info/downloads/datasets.html)  so, we organized files in the respective directories.

**FMA:**
* **preprocessingFma.py**: contains the code for cleaning and building the datasets we use in the following files
* **evaluate_features.py**: contains the code for evaluating and extracting the most important features for music genre classification
* **classifiers.py**: implementation and visualization of various classifiers effectiveness on the music gnere classification problem.
**GTZAN:**
